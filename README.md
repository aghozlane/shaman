## Introduction

SHAMAN is dedicated to metagenomic analysis, it includes the normalization, the differential analysis and mutiple visualization.  
SHAMAN is based on DESeq2 R package [Anders and Huber 2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20979621) for the analysis of metagenomic data, as suggested in [McMurdie and Holmes 2014](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3974642/) and [Jonsson2016](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4727335/).
SHAMAN robustly identifies the differential abundant genera with the Generalized Linear Model implemented in DESeq2 [Love 2014](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25516281).
Resulting p-values are adjusted according to the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure [Benjamini and Hochberg 1995].
The PCOA is performed with the ade4 R package and plots are generated with ggplot2 or D3.js packages.
A presentation about SHAMAN is available [here](www/shaman_presentation.pdf).  
SHAMAN is compatible with standard formats for metagenomic analysis. We also provide a complete pipeline for OTU picking and annotation named [MASQUE](https://github.com/aghozlane/masque) used in production at Institut Pasteur.  
Hereafter is the global workflow of the SHAMAN application:

## Installation

SHAMAN is available for R>3.X. The installation, download and execution can all be performed with a small R script :
```
# Load shiny packages
if(!require('shiny')){
 install.packages('shiny')
 library(shiny)
}

# Install dependencies, download last version of SHAMAN from github and run shaman in one command :
runGitHub('aghozlane/shaman')
```
This script can also be executed as following : 
```
chmod +x ./shaman/www/shamanapp.R && Rscript ./shaman/www/shamanapp.R
```
